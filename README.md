Implement mechanisms to handle issues like:
Missing data (e.g., absent tags or summaries).
Changes in website structure (dynamic or updated HTML).
Request timeouts or IP blocking.
Data Visualization 

Generate visual insights using Matplotlib or Seaborn:
Plot trends in article publishing over time.
Show category-wise distribution of articles.
Exporting and Reporting
